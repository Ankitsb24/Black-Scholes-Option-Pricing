1. Mathematical FormulationThe Black-Scholes-Merton model assumes that the price of the underlying asset follows a Geometric Brownian Motion with constant drift and volatility.Option Pricing FormulaThe price of a European call option ($C$) and put option ($P$) are defined as:$$C = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)$$$$P = K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S_0 N(-d_1)$$Where the components $d_1$ and $d_2$ are calculated as:$$d_1 = \frac{\ln(\frac{S_0}{K}) + (r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}$$$$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}$$$S_0$: Current price of the underlying asset.$K$: Strike price.$T$: Time to expiration (in years).$r$: Risk-free interest rate.$\sigma$: Volatility of the underlying asset.$N(\cdot)$: Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.The Greeks (Sensitivities)The engine calculates five primary risk measures:Delta ($\Delta$): $\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}$ — Sensitivity to the underlying price.Gamma ($\Gamma$): $\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}$ — Rate of change in Delta.Vega ($\nu$): $\frac{\partial V}{\partial \sigma}$ — Sensitivity to volatility.Theta ($\Theta$): $\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}$ — Sensitivity to the passage of time (Time Decay).Rho ($\rho$): $\frac{\partial V}{\partial r}$ — Sensitivity to the risk-free rate.2. Model Mechanics & AssumptionsThe model operates under the following structural assumptions to maintain analytical tractability:No Dividends: No payouts occur during the life of the option.Efficient Markets: Asset prices follow a random walk; market movements are unpredictable.Frictionless Trading: There are no transaction costs, taxes, or margin requirements.Constant Parameters: The risk-free rate and volatility are known and remain constant.Log-Normal Returns: The returns on the underlying asset are normally distributed, meaning the price itself is log-normally distributed.European Style: The option can only be exercised at the exact moment of expiration ($T$).3. Technical ImplementationTechniques UsedObject-Oriented Programming (OOP): The engine is encapsulated in a BlackScholesModel class, allowing for easy instantiation of different option contracts and modular access to pricing and Greeks.Vectorization: Leveraged NumPy arrays to allow for simultaneous pricing across a range of underlying values, essential for generating smooth visualization curves.Statistical Modeling: Utilized SciPy for high-precision normal distribution functions (CDF and PDF).Required PackagesNumPy: For numerical arrays and efficient mathematical operations.SciPy: Specifically scipy.stats.norm for probability distributions.Matplotlib: For generating the comprehensive six-panel analytical dashboard.4. Visual Analysis SuiteThe repository includes a visualization script that generates a dashboard showing how the option price and each of the five Greeks evolve as the underlying asset price moves. This is crucial for understanding Moneyness (In-the-money vs. Out-of-the-money) and its impact on risk.
